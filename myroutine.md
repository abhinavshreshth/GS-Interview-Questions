  - Revise previously solved LeetCode problems.
  - Review system design concepts (if extra time is available).

### **Work Hours (10 AM – 7 PM)**
- Focus on office work.
- If time permits (e.g., during lunch break), read FAANG interview experiences or discuss problems on LeetCode forums.

### **Evening (Post-Office Library Study)**

    - Read “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” or Grokking System Design.  
    - Watch system design videos (ByteByteGo, Gaurav Sen).  
    - Take notes and practice designing scalable architectures.
  - **9:30 PM – 11:00 PM → More LeetCode / Revision**  
    - Review previously solved problems and optimize solutions.  
    - Discuss problems in forums (optional).

### **Late Night (After Reaching Home)**

## 🔥 Additional Tips
✔ **Consistency > Intensity** → Stick to the plan, even if progress feels slow.  
✔ **Active Recall & Note-Taking** → Maintain a **notebook** for system design & tricky LeetCode patterns.  
✔ **Mock Interviews (Once a Month)** → Practice solving problems in a time-constrained, interview-like environment.
